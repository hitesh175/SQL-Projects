This project is a database schema for a fictional railway system. It includes the creation of two tables: 'stations' and 'routes', and populates them with example data. This database is designed to manage information about railway stations, their locations, and the routes that connect them.

Usage:

~ Developers and database administrators can use this project as a foundation for building a railway management system.
~ Modify the tables and schema to suit the specific needs of your railway system.
~ Expand upon this project by adding more tables and features as required.
